Specialist SA, Serverless Amazon Web Services Key Highlights Identifying the drawbacks of legacy application architecture Long product release cycles → Lost revenue/missed opportunities Inefficient operations → Reduced productivity, higher costs Non-compliance with security regulations → Security breaches, loss of reputation Transitioning to modern application architecture – Microservices Migrating to a modular system — each function is an independent service communicating via events, built on three core pillars:\nQueue Management: Handle asynchronous tasks Caching Strategy: Optimize performance Message Handling: Flexible inter-service communication Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Four-step method: Identify domain events → arrange timeline → identify actors → define bounded contexts Bookstore case study: Demonstrates real-world DDD application Context mapping: 7 patterns for integrating bounded contexts Event-Driven Architecture 3 integration patterns: Publish/Subscribe, Point-to-point, Streaming Benefits: Loose coupling, scalability, resilience Sync vs async comparison: Understanding the trade-offs Compute Evolution Shared Responsibility Model: EC2 → ECS → Fargate → Lambda Serverless benefits: No server management, auto-scaling, pay-for-value Functions vs Containers: Criteria for appropriate choice Amazon Q Developer SDLC automation: From planning to maintenance Code transformation: Java upgrade, .NET modernization AWS Transform agents: VMware, Mainframe, .NET migration Key Takeaways Design Mindset Business-first approach: Always start from the business domain, not the technology Ubiquitous language: Importance of a shared vocabulary between business and tech teams Bounded contexts: Identifying and managing complexity in large systems Technical Architecture Event storming technique: Practical method for modeling business processes Use event-driven communication instead of synchronous calls Integration patterns: When to use sync, async, pub/sub, streaming Compute spectrum: Criteria for choosing between VM, containers, and serverless Modernization Strategy Phased approach: No rushing — follow a clear roadmap 7Rs framework: Multiple modernization paths depending on the application ROI measurement: Cost reduction + business agility Applying to Work Apply DDD to current projects: Event storming sessions with business teams Refactor microservices: Use bounded contexts to define service boundaries Implement event-driven patterns: Replace some sync calls with async messaging Adopt serverless: Pilot AWS Lambda for suitable use cases Try Amazon Q Developer: Integrate into the dev workflow to boost productivity Event Experience Attending the “GenAI-powered App-DB Modernization” workshop was extremely valuable, giving me a comprehensive view of modernizing applications and databases using advanced methods and tools. Key experiences included:\nLearning from highly skilled speakers Experts from AWS and major tech organizations shared best practices in modern application design. Through real-world case studies, I gained a deeper understanding of applying DDD and Event-Driven Architecture to large projects. Hands-on technical exposure Participating in event storming sessions helped me visualize how to model business processes into domain events. Learned how to split microservices and define bounded contexts to manage large-system complexity. Understood trade-offs between synchronous and asynchronous communication and integration patterns like pub/sub, point-to-point, streaming. Leveraging modern tools Explored Amazon Q Developer, an AI tool for SDLC support from planning to maintenance. Learned to automate code transformation and pilot serverless with AWS Lambda to improve productivity. Networking and discussions The workshop offered opportunities to exchange ideas with experts, peers, and business teams, enhancing the ubiquitous language between business and tech. Real-world examples reinforced the importance of the business-first approach rather than focusing solely on technology. Lessons learned Applying DDD and event-driven patterns reduces coupling while improving scalability and resilience.

They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between your compute resources and AWS services without imposing availability risks. Compute resources running in VPC can access Amazon S3 using a Gateway endpoint. PrivateLink interface endpoints can be used by compute resources running in VPC or on-premises. Workshop overview In this workshop, you will use two VPCs.\n\u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; is for cloud resources such as a Gateway endpoint and an EC2 instance to test with. \u0026ldquo;VPC On-Prem\u0026rdquo; simulates an on-premises environment such as a factory or corporate datacenter. An EC2 instance running strongSwan VPN software has been deployed in \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; and automatically configured to establish a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel with AWS Transit Gateway. This VPN simulates connectivity from an on-premises location to the AWS cloud. To minimize costs, only one VPN instance is provisioned to support this workshop. When planning VPN connectivity for your production workloads, AWS recommends using multiple VPN devices for high availability.

Executive Summary The Security Scan \u0026amp; Deployment Pipeline project aims to automate the entire build–scan–deploy lifecycle of an application on AWS Cloud, integrating directly with GitHub to implement a practical DevSecOps workflow.\nObjectives:\nDetect security vulnerabilities and code smells early using Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer. Automatically build and produce artifacts on new commits. Store artifacts securely in Amazon S3. Automatically deploy applications to Amazon EC2 via AWS CodeDeploy. This pipeline shortens release time, improves security posture, and ensures consistency across the team\u0026rsquo;s DevSecOps processes.\n2. Problem Statement Current issues:\nManual build and code checks can miss security defects. Application deployments to EC2 are not automated, which is time-consuming and error-prone. There is no centralized system to track artifacts or security scan reports. Proposed solution:\nBuild an AWS CodePipeline connected to GitHub via webhook to automatically trigger the pipeline on each commit. The flow will be:\nCodePipeline receives commit events from GitHub. CodeBuild builds the source and runs security analysis using Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer. Build artifacts and scan results are uploaded to Amazon S3. CodeDeploy pulls artifacts from S3 and deploys them to EC2. The entire process is observable via the AWS Console and CloudWatch Logs. Benefits and ROI:\nReduce manual deployment time by 60–70%. Improve security through automated CodeGuru analysis. Ensure a closed-loop CI/CD process, reducing misconfiguration risk. Lower operational costs through automation. 3. Solution Architecture The pipeline is designed as a DevSecOps Serverless Hybrid architecture, combining AWS services to provide end-to-end automation.\nOverview diagram:\nAWS services used:\nAWS CodePipeline: orchestrates automated pipeline stages. AWS CodeBuild: builds the project and runs security scans. Amazon CodeGuru Reviewer: analyzes source code and reports issues. Amazon S3: stores artifacts and scan outputs. AWS CodeDeploy: deploys artifacts to EC2 instances. Amazon EC2: runtime environment for the application. Amazon SNS: sends build/deploy notifications. CloudWatch, CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Detective, Security Hub: monitoring, investigation, and security aggregation. 4. Technical Deployment Deployment stages:\nConnect GitHub to CodePipeline: create a webhook and grant access via OIDC or a PAT; configure the pipeline to run on commits. Create a CodeBuild project: environment (Ubuntu + Node.js/Python). Write a buildspec.yml to build and invoke CodeGuru. Configure CodeDeploy: create a Deployment Group linked to EC2 instances and provide an appspec.yml. Monitoring \u0026amp; security: CloudWatch collects pipeline and application logs. AWS CloudTrail records API activity and user actions. GuardDuty detects suspicious behavior. Detective helps analyze incident root causes. Security Hub aggregates findings across services. SNS sends pipeline status notifications to developers. 5. Roadmap \u0026amp; Milestones Pre-internship (September): 1 month planning — research, create IAM Roles, S3 bucket, EC2 instances, and connect GitHub. Internship (October–November): October: configure CodePipeline and GitHub webhooks. November: author buildspec.yml and appspec.yml, integrate CodeGuru, and add monitoring/security services (SNS, GuardDuty, Detective, Security Hub). Post-deployment: further research and improvements. 6. Budget Estimate See the cost estimate on the AWS Pricing Calculator: https://calculator.aws/#/estimate?id=621f38b12a1ef026842ba2ddfe46ff936ed4ab01 Or download the budget estimation file: ../attachments/budget_estimation.pdf.\nEstimated infrastructure costs:\nAWS CodePipeline: $0.40/month (2 pipelines running daily). AWS CodeBuild: $0.35/month (30 builds, 5 minutes each). Amazon S3: $0.10/month (artifacts \u0026amp; logs). AWS CodeDeploy: $0.20/month (2 deployments/month). Amazon EC2 (t2.micro): $0.10/month (application instance). CloudWatch + SNS: $0.05/month (monitoring \u0026amp; notifications). Estimated total: ≈ $1.20/month, $14.40/year (assuming AWS Free Tier offsets).\n7. Risk Assessment Risk matrix:\nGitHub webhook failure — CodePipeline not triggered. Timeouts during CodeGuru analysis or CodeBuild runs. Missing or corrupted artifacts during deployment to EC2. Pipeline interruption due to IAM permission issues. Costs exceeding AWS Free Tier limits. Mitigation strategies:\nVerify IAM Role configuration, OAuth tokens, and GitHub webhook triggers. Limit scan scope and optimize buildspec.yml to analyze only changed code. Run unit tests before building and use checksums to validate artifact integrity. Validate IAM policies for CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, S3, and SNS. Set up AWS Budgets and billing alerts via SNS email notifications. Contingency plan:\nManually trigger pipelines via the AWS Console or AWS CLI if automatic triggers fail. If timeouts occur, split the pipeline (e.g., separate build and scan stages) or run fallback jobs during off-peak hours. Use CodeDeploy rollback to revert to the previous artifact stored in S3 if a deployment fails. Create a backup IAM role with equivalent permissions to activate temporarily if the main role has issues. If costs spike, pause non-essential pipelines, clean up S3, and stop EC2 instances. 8. Expected Outcomes Technical achievements:\nFull automation of CI/CD and security scanning. Continuous code and security analysis using CodeGuru. Seamless deployments via CodeDeploy to EC2. Comprehensive monitoring via CloudWatch, Detective, and Security Hub. Immediate email alerts through SNS. Long-term value:\nA DevSecOps reference pattern suitable for workshops, learning, and real-world deployments. Potential extensions:\nAutomated testing. Deployments to ECS/EKS or AWS Lambda. Integrate additional scanners like Trivy, SonarQube, or Checkov for broader security coverage.

Connect to EC2 with session manager For this workshop, you will use AWS Session Manager to access several EC2 instances. Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that allows you to manage your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.\nFirst cloud journey Lab for indepth understanding of Session manager.\nIn the AWS Management Console, start typing Systems Manager in the quick search box and press Enter: From the Systems Manager menu, find Node Management in the left menu and click Session Manager: Click Start Session, and select the EC2 instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. This EC2 instance is already running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; and will be used to test connectivity to Amazon S3 through the Gateway endpoint you just created (s3-gwe).\nSession Manager will open a new browser tab with a shell prompt: sh-4.2 $\nYou have successfully start a session - connect to the EC2 instance in VPC cloud. In the next step, we will create a S3 bucket and a file in it.\nCreate a file and upload to s3 bucket Change to the ssm-user\u0026rsquo;s home directory by typing cd ~ in the CLI Create a new file to use for testing with the command fallocate -l 1G testfile.xyz, which will create a file of 1GB size named \u0026ldquo;testfile.xyz\u0026rdquo;. Upload file to S3 bucket with command aws s3 cp testfile.xyz s3://your-bucket-name. Replace your-bucket-name with the name of S3 bucket that you created earlier. You have successfully uploaded the file to your S3 bucket. You can now terminate the session.\nCheck object in S3 bucket Navigate to S3 console. Click the name of your s3 bucket In the Bucket console, you will see the file you have uploaded to your S3 bucket Section summary Congratulation on completing access to S3 from VPC. In this section, you created a Gateway endpoint for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to upload an object. The upload worked because the Gateway endpoint allowed communication to S3, without needing an Internet Gateway attached to \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo;. This demonstrates the functionality of the Gateway endpoint as a secure path to S3 without traversing the Public Internet.\n"},{"uri":"https://thienluhoan.github.io/workshop-template/1-worklog/1.10-week10/week10_index/","title":"Week 10 Worklog","tags":[],"description":"","content":" ⚠️ Note: The following information is for reference purposes only.

Interface endpoints work with resources running in VPC, and also resources running in on-premises environments. Connectivty from your on-premises environment to the cloud can be provided by AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect.

These IP addresses are attached to Elastic Network Interfaces (ENIs). AWS recommends using DNS to resolve the IP addresses for endpoints so that downstream applications use the latest IP addresses when ENIs are added to new AZs, or deleted over time.\nIn this section, you will create a forwarding rule to send DNS resolution requests from a simulated on-premises environment to a Route 53 Private Hosted Zone.

Outside of a workshop environment, you might use this feature to forward DNS queries from your VPC to DNS servers running on-premises. In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution. The dig command will return the IP addresses assigned to the VPC Interface endpoint running in VPC Cloud (your IP\u0026rsquo;s will be different): dig +short s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com The IP addresses returned are the VPC endpoint IP addresses, NOT the Resolver IP addresses you pasted from your text editor. The IP addresses of the Resolver endpoint and the VPC endpoint look similar because they are all from the VPC Cloud CIDR block.\nNavigate to the VPC menu (Endpoints section), select the S3 Interface endpoint. Click the Subnets tab and verify that the IP addresses returned by Dig match the VPC endpoint: Return to your shell and use the AWS CLI to test listing your S3 buckets: aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com Terminate your Session Manager session: In this section you created an Interface endpoint for Amazon S3.

Why use IAM Permission Boundaries?\nTypically, when you grant permissions to IAM users, you might think carefully crafting user policies is enough and skip using Permission Boundaries.\nHowever, as the number of users grows and continuous changes in job roles require creating many new policies, permission management becomes complex and can introduce gaps that allow privilege escalation among users.\nTo simplify permission management, instead of editing each permission policy, you can apply Permission Boundaries quickly and consistently to help close privilege escalation gaps.\nApplications of IAM\nIAM cannot perform authentication for applications. For example, on-premises applications using AD for authentication will need AWS Directory Service (setup \u0026amp; migration) when moved to AWS.\nIAM does not manage OS-level authentication.

A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint. If you do not attach a policy when you create an endpoint, AWS attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the service through the endpoint.\nYou can create a policy that restricts access to specific S3 buckets only. This is useful if you only want certain S3 Buckets to be accessible through the endpoint.\nIn this section you will create a VPC endpoint policy that restricts access to the S3 bucket specified in the VPC endpoint policy.\nConnect to an EC2 instance and verify connectivity to S3 Start a new AWS Session Manager session on the instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. From the session, verify that you can list the contents of the bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC: aws s3 ls s3://\\\u0026lt;your-bucket-name\\\u0026gt; The bucket contents include the two 1 GB files uploaded in earlier.\nCreate a new S3 bucket; follow the naming pattern you used in Part 1, but add a \u0026lsquo;-2\u0026rsquo; to the name.

A Data Lake is simply a repository that stores raw (unprocessed) data waiting to be processed, analyzed and turned into insights.\nData Lake characteristics:\nCollect everything – stores raw or processed data over long periods. Multi-user – allows many users to refine, explore and enrich data. Flexible access – supports many access patterns on shared infrastructure: batch, interactive, online, search, in-memory and other processing tools. Learnings about DynamoDB\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that delivers fast, predictable performance with seamless scalability. DynamoDB reduces the operational burden of running and scaling a distributed database by handling hardware provisioning, setup and configuration, replication, software patching and cluster scaling. DynamoDB also provides encryption at rest.\nDynamoDB creates database tables that can store and retrieve any amount of data and serve any level of request traffic. You can scale capacity up or down for your tables without downtime or performance degradation. DynamoDB provides on-demand backups. You can create full backups of your tables for long-term retention and compliance. You can enable point-in-time recovery (PITR) for DynamoDB tables to protect against accidental writes or deletes. With PITR you can restore a table to any point in the last 35 days. DynamoDB supports automatic expiration of items (time-to-live) to reduce storage usage and costs for stale data.
