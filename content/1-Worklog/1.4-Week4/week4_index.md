### Week 4 Objectives:

* Practice VM Import/Export — a lab built on knowledge from previous labs. To complete this lab you need AWS CLI installed and a virtualization environment (e.g., VMware Workstation).
* Prepare the workshop environment, including creating an S3 bucket and launching an EC2 instance using the AMI Storage Gateway provided by AWS.
* Amazon S3.
* Theory:
  + Shared Responsibility Model
  + AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  + Amazon Cognito
  + AWS Organizations
  + AWS Identity Center
  + AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
  + AWS Security Hub

* Module 04

### Week 4 Results:

* VM Import/Export deployment
  * VM Import/Export allows importing virtual machines (VMs) from your virtualization environment into Amazon EC2 and exporting them back. This enables:
    - Migrating applications and infrastructure from on‑premises virtualization to Amazon EC2
    - Backing up VMs to EC2
    - Creating a repository of VMs for disaster recovery and restore

* File Storage Gateway deployment
  * How to create a Storage Gateway
  * How to create File Shares
  * How to connect File Shares from on‑premises

* Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that provides on‑demand scalability, high data availability, strong security, and high performance.
  * S3 is designed to meet customer needs across all sizes and industries and can be used to store and protect any amount of data.

* Introduction to AWS Security Hub

* Using Lambda functions to optimize costs in your AWS environment — for example, automating start/stop of servers that only need to run a few hours per day.
